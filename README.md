## Aim :
*To print "Hello World", create a calculator program and understand the following concepts:*

 - Introduce Basic C++ Syntax: Demonstrate the fundamental structure of a C++ program, including header inclusion, the main() function, and the use of the return statement.
 - Teach Basic Input/Output: Show how to use the `cout` function to print text to the console, introducing standard output handling in C++.

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of beginner-level C++ programs that focus on teaching the essential concepts of programming. The aim is to help learners understand how C++ works through simple, practical examples such as printing messages, performing arithmetic operations, and handling user input and output via the console.

## 1. Hello World! Program

This is often the very first program written when starting to learn any programming language. It introduces key concepts like syntax, functions and input/output. The "Hello, World!" program is very simple, but it teaches you how a C++ program is written. It shows you:

- How to use `#include <iostream>` to do input and output.

- That every program starts from the `main()` function.

- How `cout` is used to print something on the screen

**Sample Output:**

Hello World !
This Is My First C++ Code !

## Importance of this code :
This simple code helps us learn how to print text on the screen and understand the basic format of a C++ program .

## 2. Simple Calculator Program
This program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two numbers as input, carries out the calculations, and then displays the results.

**Pseudocode :**
 - The user is prompted to input two numerical values using `cin`

 - The program stores these values in variables

 - It performs the four arithmetic operations using basic operators

 - Results are displayed with appropriate labels using `cout`

**Sample Output :**

Enter the first number : 72 

Enter the second number 56  

Sum of the given numbers : 128  
The product of num1 and num2 is : 4032  
The division of num1 and num2 is : 1.28   
The subtraction of num1 and num2 is : 16 

## Importance of this code : 
this code helps us learn how to :

 - take user input using `cin`

 - declare and use variables to store data

 - arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and / work in C++

 - display well-formatted output for better readability

 - Basic logic and structure of a command-line based program

## Conclusion
These two foundational programs provide a strong starting point for learning the C++ programming language. They cover key beginner-level concepts such as:

 - Understanding the program structure

 - Using variables and data types

 - Performing basic arithmetic

 - Handling one or more inputs and outputs
